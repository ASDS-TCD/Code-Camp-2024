# An R session should begin as an empty space, i.e. there
# should be no *objects* in our environment. 

# The ls() *function* shows us a *list* of objects in 
# our environment. To run this code, place the cursor
# on the line, and then press *ctrl* and *enter*.

ls()

# Look at some data sets (as we did before RStudio)

mean(Nile)
plot(Nile)
hist(Nile)

# Now let's make an object. To make an object, we need a
# name (here "x"), and some value(s) to assign to it. We 
# use the *assignment operator* <- to assign the name to
# the value.

x <- "Hello world"

# Now try calling x.
x

# And see what happens when we call the ls() function again.
ls()

# Simple commands

# R calculates stuff, e.g., add 2 and 2
2 + 2

# Create 7 random numbers between 0 and 1
runif(7)

# R allows for two different versions to assign a value to a name
z <- 2 + 2 #better way
z = 2 + 2

# "c" stands for concatenate so "y" here stores the values 1, 2 and 4.
y <- c(1, 2, 4)

#Parts of individual objects can be accessed via square brackets
y[3]

# We can access multiple parts of objects with a colon
y[2:3]

# Suppose now we want the sum of y
sum(y)

# Store the output of a function in another object
z <- sum(y)
# Notice we replaced the former "z" object


# Can you use the sqrt() function to compute the square root of 962?

# Answer?

# Can you now assign to a new object?



######
# OOP
######

# R is an *object-oriented programming language*. This 
# means, essentially, that we make objects with functions,
# which we then manipulate with other functions.

# The rm() function can be used to *remove* objects. Here,
# we are passing the contents of the *list* created by
# calling the ls() function which we used earlier. Do
# not worry if this is unclear for now: we are simply 
# clearing our workspace.

rm(list = ls())

# Here, we assign the value "Hello" to the object "x". 

x <- "Hello"

# The class() function tells us what *class* of object 
# we have just created, in this case an object of 
# class *character*.

class(x)

# The length() function tells us how many discrete 
# values or elements the object contains. 

length(x)

# Here, we have length = 1. Is this the result you were 
# expecting?

# We can use square brackets [] after an object's name to
# access a particular element by its *index*. Indexes in R
# begin at 1. x[1] is therefore "Hello". We can use [] 
# together with the *assignment operator* <- to add an 
# element to x, here the word "world", which will be stored
# in the second index position. 

x[2] <- "world"

# We now have a *character vector* of length 2. 
# The str_length() function returns the number of 
# characters within each discrete element of
# x, here 5, 5 for [1] Hello, and [2] world.

x
length(x)


# If the elements of your vector have names, you can extract them by name.
# To do so place a name or vector of names in the brackets behind a vector. Surround each name with quotation marks

# Extract the element named gamma from the vector below.
vec2 <- c(alpha = 1, beta = 2, gamma = 3)




# We can use functions to create objects. Here, we use
# rnorm() to create an object comprising 50 *random* 
# numbers drawn from the *normal distribution* family
# (here with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1: 
# these are the default settings for the function).

x <- rnorm(n = 50)
length(x)
mean(x)
sd(x)


# Use rnrom() to generate 100 random normal values 
# with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15.




#Now assign them to an object named data.
#Then, on a new line, call the hist() function on data
# to plot a histogram of the random values.




# A strength of R is that many functions will be applied
# automatically to every element in an object. Here, the
# multiplication function * takes the *scalar* input 2 
# and applies it to each discrete element in y. We then
# simultaneously assign the result of this operation back
# onto y using the assignment operator.

y <- x
y <- 2*y

# Many functions return large *lists* of objects. Here, 
# we use the lm() or *linear model* function to apply a 
# linear regression of the objects y and x on each other, 
# and assign the results to a new object, xylm. 

xylm <- lm(y~x)
xylm


# We use the attributes() function to list the objects 
# created by lm(). 

attributes(xylm)

# We use the summary() function to provide an output of 
# summary statistics. Unsurprisingly, we discover that the 
# slope of y is 2. 

summary(xylm)

# When we plot() x and y, they are perfectly linear. Note 
# that R provided us with a helpful warning that this is the
# case in the output of summary().

plot(x,y)

# One of the objects which lm() creates is the value of 
# the *residuals* (i.e. the values "left over" between
# the predicted and actual values of y). We can access 
# these by using the "$" operator. When a function creates
# a *list* of objects, passing the name of the "top level"
# object (here, xylm) followed by $ and then the "lower
# level" object allows us to access the latter. 

xylm$residuals
plot(xylm$residuals)

###########
# FUNctions
###########

# As well as being an object-oriented language, R is also
# a *functional* language. This essentially means that,
# rather than constantly writing loops in our code, we can
# express iterative behaviour implicitly. 

# Here is the long way of creating an object comprising
# a vector of the numbers 1 to 10.

x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)

# Here is a *loop* doing the same thing. (Don't worry if 
# this doesn't make sense yet).

x <- vector("double", 10)
for(i in 1:10){
  x[i] <- i
}  

# And here is the seq() function doing the same: a large
# saving in mental effort.
  
x <- seq(1:10)

# Be careful though: here, if we want to add the number
# 11 onto the end of our sequence, we must use the c()
# function. If we "add" using the + function, R will
# add 11 to each discrete element in x.

y <- x + 11
y <- c(x, 11)

# Every operator is itself a function, as we see by
# calling help on the operator within quote marks.

?"+"

?"c"

?"<-"

# Here, we use a number of different functions separately
# to calculate the *standard deviation* of our sequence, x.
# Does this tally with the result we obtain by calling
# the sd() function?

xMean <- mean(x)
xLength <- length(x)
xDev <- x - xMean
xDevSq <- xDev^2
xSumDevSq <- sum(xDevSq)
xVar <- xSumDevSq/xLength
xSD <- sqrt(xVar)

sd(x)
?sd

# Caution: sd() (and the var() function) assume you are 
# using *sample* statistics, for which the denominator
# is n-1: 

xVar_s <- xSumDevSq/(xLength - 1)
XSD_s <- sqrt(xVar_s)
sd(x)


# One of R's strengths is the large number of *packages*
# which users have created for different tasks. Packages
# contain functions which we can use on our data.

# The search() function shows us which packages are loaded
# in our R session. 

search()

# The install.packages() function allows us to install new
# packages from the web. Here, we are installing a suite
# of packages known as the "tidyverse".

install.packages("tidyverse")

# Installing a package does not make it available to us in
# our R session. To make a package available, along with
# its functions, we need to use the library() function.

library("tidyverse")

search()

# The tidyverse packages are now listed in our session.

#######
# Help!
#######

# There are many ways of accessing help in R. The help()
# function is the main method. Its shortcut is "?". 

help(tidyverse)
?tidyverse
?persp

# The example() function provides an interactive demo

example(persp)

# Some packages have *vignettes*, which go into more 
# detail than R help files (which can be very terse). 
# The vignette() function accesses these, or use
# browseVignettes(package = "name") to search.

?dplyr
vignette("dplyr")
browseVignettes(package = "dplyr")

# If you're looking for help on a particular area, and
# aren't sure what function or package to use, try the
# help.search() function. 

help.search("standard deviation")

# Taking R for a spin
#####################

# Let's finish by seeing a little of what R is capable of.

# mtcars is a built-in dataset contained in R's datasets
# library. It is, unsurprisingly, a dataset about cars. 

?mtcars

# The summary() function provides some summary statistics
# of the dataset.

summary(mtcars)

# The str() function provides information about the *structure* 
# of the dataset.

str(mtcars)

# The head() function provides the first 6 entries in each variable. 

head(mtcars)

# The ls.str() function combines the ls() and str() functions.

ls.str(mtcars)

# These are all useful functions to remember when
# exploring a new dataset.

# The below example makes use of the ggplot package (a 
# more advanced graphics package than base R graphics)
# to produce a scatter plot which is able simultaneously
# to show the relationship between five variables: the
# weight of the car, its fuel economy, the number of 
# cylinders, its horsepower and type of transmission. 
# Further, three trend lines show the relationship 
# between weight and mpg for 4, 6 and 8 cylinder cars. 

mtcars$am <- as.factor(mtcars$am)
mtcars$cyl <- as.factor(mtcars$cyl)

ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg, size = hp)) +
  geom_text(aes(size = hp, label = cyl, color = am)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(linetype = cyl), color = "grey", size = 0.5, se = FALSE, show.legend = FALSE) +
  guides(size = "none") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank(), legend.justification = c(1, 1), legend.position = c(1, 1)) +
  scale_color_manual(labels = c("manual", "automatic"), values = c("blue", "red")) +
  labs(title = "Plot of Fuel Efficiency by Weight for 32 Cars", subtitle = "Number of cylinders; size = horsepower") +
  xlab("weight (1000 lbs)")

# It is not always a good idea to show so many variables
# simultaneously, but the plot gives a good idea of what
# is possible with R. Again, do not worry about the 
# specifics of the code at this point.

# The mpg dataset is a built in dataset for the ggplot
